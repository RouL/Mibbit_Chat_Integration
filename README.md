Mibbit Chat Integration
=======================

This WCF plugin integrates a Mibbit IRC chat widget into your applications.

It will automatically use the username as nick in the chat for registered users. If the name contains chars that aren't allowed the plugin will replace them with allowed chars.
The plugin offers a lot of configuration options for adjusting the widget to fit your needs.

Mibbit is "only" a webclient for so called "Internet Relay Chat Server (IRC Server)". To get an introduction to operating an IRC channel i would suggest you reading this page: http://helios-matrix.net/IRCMan/ (I'll give no support in using IRC!)

Mibbit is replacing those ugly Java applets. Mibbit is not only good for avoiding the usage of a Java applet. With Mibbit you can even connect to IRC when you're behind a firewall.
